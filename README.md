# dipreco

Welcome to dipreco's issues and discussions place.

## What is dipreco

**dipreco** stands for **DI**saster **PRE**vention and re**CO**very. Basically it's a set of tools which should help you to be safe while using Linux together with CoW filesystems like btrfs or ZFS.

Currently we have:

* [Daemon](https://github.com/dipreco/daemon), which should be installed where your filesystem you'll manage lives.
* [Client](https://github.com/dipreco/client), which should be installed on your machine to control local and remote daemons.

## Rules Of Usage

Please, follow this three simple rules on how to use issues and discussions:

* If you found a bug, undesired behaviour or something similar - [post new issue](https://github.com/dipreco/dipreco/issues).
* If you want ask for help (with installation, configuration, usage) - [start a discussion](https://github.com/dipreco/dipreco/discussions).
* If you want to request some feature - [start a discussion](https://github.com/dipreco/dipreco/discussions) first. After accepting it'll transfer to issues (or will be buried forever).

These rules is about distinguishing chit-chat (like "help to install", "I wanna feature X, do it!") and real bug reports and accepted feature requests.

**Asking for help in "Issues" section or writing about feature request without discussing it in "Discussions" section will result in issue deletion without further notice!**
